## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwindcss
- Frontend Mentor Challenges

### What I learned, approach and customizations made

I have learnt to use the css libraries - tailwindcss efficiently. 
To understand the layout better I manually drew the layout, writing how many columns and grids I need and how it can be aligned. 
So that approcah helped me even if I change the size or the grid itself. Also I had a seperate backup file to work on, so that I dont disturb the main one. Was keep updating in each stage. 


### Continued development

I will be using the frontend mentor in future projects with the Intermediate and Advance challenges. Also I ll be using
